check_doc_layout.py — every document in doc/ has the same shape, and its Table
of Contents is the list of sections it actually contains.

The documentation set is eleven Markdown files written over as many months, and
they had drifted into eleven layouts: four had no Table of Contents at all, the
seven that did called it "Contents" or "Table of Contents" about evenly, the
metadata under the title used five different key sets, and section numbering was
present in six documents and absent in five. A reader who opened two of them in
a row could not tell they belonged to one set.

Layout drift is invisible to every other gate here — a document with no TOC
renders perfectly, publishes perfectly, and every link in it resolves. So the
shape is pinned in one place instead of being restated in eleven:

  * "# Title" on line 1, then a blockquote of exactly
    "**Spec version:**", "**Status:**", "**Scope:**";
  * a "## Table of Contents" section, before the first numbered section;
  * "## N. Title" sections numbered 1..N without gaps (appendices excepted),
    "### N.M Title" subsections numbered within their section, each "##"
    preceded by a "---" rule;
  * a TOC that lists every "##" and "###" heading, in document order, with the
    anchor each heading actually gets — this is the part that rots fastest,
    because adding a section is one edit and remembering the TOC is another;
  * a "## See also" section and the closing "*End of … (Bovnar spec 1.1).*"
    line.

The anchor slugs are computed with gen_html_docs.gh_slug — the same function
that assigns the ids on the published HTML pages — so a TOC that passes here
cannot be a TOC whose links 404 on the site. check_web_links.py then proves the
same for links between documents; this one is about a document's own structure.

Usage:
    python3 check_doc_layout.py            # report and exit 1 on any drift
    python3 check_doc_layout.py --verbose  # also list what was checked
