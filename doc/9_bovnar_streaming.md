# Bovnar — Streaming, Framing & Multiplexing

> **Spec version:** 1.1
> **Status:** Reference — protocols layered on the event API, not part of the wire format
> **Scope:** Endless streaming, multi-document framing, octet multiplexing, and embedded documents.

This document describes four capabilities layered **on top of** the Bovnar
lexer/validator event API, *beside* the DOM. None of them change the frozen 1.0
grammar or wire format (see the [Specification](1_bovnar_spec.md)); they are
applications built on the SAX-style event pipe and the octet-stream value form.

| # | Capability | Where it lives | Header |
|---|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Endless streaming | core policy knob | `bovnar.h` |
| 2 | Multi-document framing | transport beside the lexer | `bovnar_stream.h` |
| 3 | Octet multiplexing | convention inside one octet stream | `bovnar_stream.h` |
| 4 | Document-in-document | a document embedded as octet payload | `bovnar_stream.h` |

The mental model: the **reader** turns bytes into a `bvnr_event_t` stream and the
**writer** turns events back into bytes. The DOM is one consumer of that pipe;
everything here is another. Octet streams (spec §9) are the binary substrate —
opaque, chunked, UTF-8-validation-suspended byte regions — and three of the four
capabilities are sub-protocols carried in or around them.

## 1. Endless streaming

Every byte/offset/line/column counter in the core is 64-bit, so a single
never-ending document — or a single octet stream of unbounded length — is
limited only by one policy knob: `max_file_size` on `bvnr_read_flags_t` /
`bvnr_write_flags_t`.

```c
#define BVNR_FILESIZE_UNLIMITED  0   /* in bovnar.h */
```

Semantics — **`0` is unlimited and the default**:

| `max_file_size` value | Effect |
|-----------------------|--------|
| `0` (= `BVNR_FILESIZE_UNLIMITED`, the default) | **No cap** — endless, no accumulated size limit |
| any positive N | Cap at N bytes (`error_file_too_long` beyond) |

```c
bvnr_read_flags_t fl = {
    .on_verified   = my_cb,
    .max_file_size = BVNR_FILESIZE_UNLIMITED,   /* endless */
};
```

A long-lived document is processed incrementally: process each value in the
`on_verified`/`on_unverified` callback and retain nothing, and memory stays flat
regardless of stream length. (The DOM builder, by contrast, retains a tree and
is therefore not the tool for an endless stream.)

---

## 2. Multi-document record framing

The grammar has no in-band document separator: a reader ends one document at EOF.
To carry a **sequence of independent documents** over one byte stream (file,
socket, pipe) without closing it, wrap each in a length-prefixed frame. The
framing lives beside the lexer; each payload is a complete, standalone document
parsed by an ordinary reader.

### 2.1 Wire format

```
frame   = "BVF1"            ; 4-byte magic
          payload_len       ; uint64, little-endian
          payload[payload_len]
stream  = { frame }         ; terminated by EOF on a frame boundary
```

A clean EOF *before any header byte* ends the sequence successfully; an EOF
part-way through a header or payload is a truncation error.

### 2.2 API

```c
/* Producer */
bool bvnr_frame_write(bvnr_sink_t* sink, const void* doc, uint64_t doc_len);

/* Consumer */
typedef struct {
    bvnr_read_flags_t* flags;            /* per-document reader callbacks/limits */
    void*              userdata;
    bool (*on_document)(void* ud, uint64_t index, bool ok, error_code_t err);
    bool               continue_past_failed; /* keep going after a failed document */
    uint64_t           max_document_size;    /* 0 => BVNR_DOC_DEFAULT_MAX (256 MiB) */
} bvnr_doc_stream_opts_t;

bool bvnr_doc_stream_read(bvnr_source_t* src,
                          const bvnr_doc_stream_opts_t* opts,
                          uint64_t* out_count);
```

`bvnr_doc_stream_read` reads frames until EOF, parsing each payload with a fresh
reader (reusing one handle internally) and invoking `on_document` after each. It
returns false on a framing/IO error, or on the first per-document parse failure
unless `continue_past_failed` is set. Each frame payload is buffered in RAM
before parsing (the buffer grows with the bytes that actually arrive, so a
crafted oversized length cannot force a large up-front allocation), bounded by
`max_document_size`. Unlike `max_file_size`, this framing guard stays finite when
`0` (it then selects `BVNR_DOC_DEFAULT_MAX`, 256 MiB); set an explicit huge cap
(e.g. `UINT64_MAX`) to lift it.

Two **orthogonal** error controls — because each document occupies its own
length-delimited frame, the two are independent:

| Control | Scope | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `flags->continue_on_error` | *within* a document | resync/recover from errors inside one document |
| `continue_past_failed` | *across* documents | report a failed document and advance to the next frame instead of aborting |

So you can parse each document **strictly** (`continue_on_error = false`) yet
**resiliently** process every frame (`continue_past_failed = true`), reporting the
bad ones via `on_document` — the natural mode for a log of independent records.

### 2.3 CLI

```sh
bovnar frames pack a.bvnr b.bvnr c.bvnr > docs.bvf   # wrap each file in a frame
bovnar frames list docs.bvf                          # list documents + status
bovnar frames list -                                 # read the frame stream from stdin
```

## 3. Octet multiplexing (out-of-band channels, cross-chunk)

Many logical channels interleaved inside a **single octet-stream value**. The
channel id and message framing are a convention interpreted *above* `ev_data`,
so to the lexer these are ordinary `0x01` data chunks and `bvnr_data_t` needs no
channel field. The 1.0 wire format is untouched.

### 3.1 Wire convention (two layers)

```
per octet chunk:    varint(channel)  fragment_bytes
per channel:        concat(fragments in order) = the channel's logical stream,
                    a sequence of length-prefixed messages:
                        varint(msg_len)  msg_bytes
```

- `varint` is unsigned LEB128 (1 byte for channels/lengths < 128; up to 10 bytes).
- A message is **length-prefixed**, so it may span any number of chunks, and
  channels may interleave freely at chunk granularity — the demultiplexer
  reassembles each channel independently. Both the message data **and** its
  length varint may straddle chunk boundaries (the demux accumulates a partial
  length varint per channel).
- `BVNR_MUX_MAX_MESSAGE` is a conservative **single-chunk guarantee**, not an
  enforced cap: any message of at most that many bytes is emitted by
  `bvnr_mux_send` in one chunk regardless of channel id or length magnitude
  (it subtracts the maximum 10+10 varint bytes from the 64 KiB chunk). Larger
  messages are simply split; nothing rejects them.
- **The one wire requirement:** the per-chunk **channel** varint — the routing
  prefix the demux needs to attribute a chunk — is whole within its chunk.
  `bvnr_mux_send` always satisfies this (the channel id is ≤ 10 bytes and leads
  every chunk).

### 3.2 API

```c
/* Producer */
bool bvnr_mux_begin(bvnr_writer_t* w, const char* key);
bool bvnr_mux_send (bvnr_writer_t* w, uint64_t channel,
                    const void* data, uint64_t len);   /* split as needed */
bool bvnr_mux_end  (bvnr_writer_t* w);

/* Consumer */
typedef bool (*bvnr_mux_on_msg_fn)(void* ud, uint64_t channel,
                                   const uint8_t* data, uint64_t len);

bvnr_demux_t* bvnr_demux_create(bvnr_mux_on_msg_fn on_message,
                                void* userdata, uint64_t max_message);
void          bvnr_demux_destroy(bvnr_demux_t* dm);
bool          bvnr_demux_set_key (bvnr_demux_t* dm, const char* key);
bool          bvnr_demux_on_event(void* demux, bvnr_event_t ev, bvnr_data_t* d);
error_code_t  bvnr_demux_error(const bvnr_demux_t* dm);
```

Install `bvnr_demux_on_event` as `bvnr_read_flags_t.on_verified` with `userdata`
set to the `bvnr_demux_t*`. It peels the channel varint off each chunk,
reassembles per-channel messages (owning a buffer per active channel), and
invokes `on_message` for each complete message. A malformed varint, an oversized
declared length (> `max_message`, default 64 MiB), or an allocation failure
latches `bvnr_demux_error` and aborts the read. If `on_message` returns false the
read is aborted and `bvnr_demux_error` reports `error_scanner_callback_failed`
(distinct from the desync code, so a deliberate stop is distinguishable from a
framing error).

A separate, non-fatal case: if the octet stream *ends* while a channel is still
mid-message (or mid-length-varint), the octet framing itself was well-formed, so
the read still **succeeds** — but the partial message is dropped and
`bvnr_demux_error` latches `error_octet_stream_truncated`. This is deliberately a
different code from the desync `error_octet_stream_out_of_sync`: a truncated
message is a message-layer loss, not a framing error. Always check
`bvnr_demux_error` after the read even when it returned true.

**Key scoping.** By default the demux treats *every* octet stream in the document
as multiplexed. Call `bvnr_demux_set_key(dm, "mux")` so it only demuxes streams
opened under that key — a document can then mix one mux stream with ordinary
binary octet payloads (those under other keys are ignored, not misread as
framing). Pass `NULL` to clear the filter.

**Memory.** The demux keeps one reassembly buffer per channel it has seen; each
grows to that channel's largest message and is retained for reuse until
`bvnr_demux_destroy`, so steady-state memory is the sum of per-channel high-water
marks (bounded by 4096 channels). Channels are not reclaimed individually.

```c
bvnr_demux_t* dm = bvnr_demux_create(on_message, ctx, 0 /* default cap */);
bvnr_read_flags_t fl = { .on_verified = bvnr_demux_on_event, .userdata = dm };
/* ... open_read_* + bvnr_read ... */
if (bvnr_demux_error(dm) != error_none) { /* desync, oversize, alloc, or a truncated message */ }
bvnr_demux_destroy(dm);
```

### 3.3 CLI

```sh
bovnar mux pack 1:req.bvnr 42:log.bvnr > mux.bvnr   # files onto channels 1 and 42
bovnar mux list mux.bvnr                            # channel <n>: <len> bytes
bovnar mux pack 7:a.bvnr | bovnar mux list -        # pipe producer to consumer
```

---

## 4. Document-in-document

Embed a complete Bovnar document as the octet-stream payload of a key. The outer
parser treats the inner document as opaque octets; only an application that knows
the key holds a nested document re-feeds those bytes to a sub-reader. This is the
natural recursion primitive — no envelope type, just the octet-stream value form.

```c
/* Producer: emits  .<key> = <octets of doc>;  (64 KiB chunks) */
bool bvnr_embed_document(bvnr_writer_t* w, const char* key,
                         const void* doc, uint64_t doc_len);

/* Consumer: parse the embedded bytes with an ordinary reader (recursion). */
bool bvnr_parse_embedded(const void* doc, uint64_t doc_len,
                         bvnr_read_flags_t* flags);
```

To recurse while reading the outer document, accumulate the octet chunks for the
known key between `ev_octet_stream_start` and `ev_octet_stream_end`, then call
`bvnr_parse_embedded` on the accumulated bytes with the nested callbacks:

```c
case ev_octet_stream_end:
    if (in_payload)
        bvnr_parse_embedded(buf, len, &inner_flags);   /* parses the nested doc */
    break;
```

The inner callbacks may themselves embed/extract further documents, so nesting
is arbitrarily deep (bounded by your own recursion budget).

---

## 5. Python bindings

All four capabilities are exposed through the `bovnar.stream` module (a thin
ctypes layer over the C functions, so framing, varint reassembly and the
strict-vs-resilient document policy behave identically):

```python
import bovnar
from bovnar import stream

# Multi-document framing
blob = stream.dump_documents([{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}])     # list[dict] -> bytes
docs = stream.load_documents(blob)                        # bytes -> list[dict]
docs = stream.load_documents(blob, continue_past_failed=True)  # bad docs -> None

# Octet multiplexing (channel, payload) — any size, interleaved
m   = stream.mux_dump([(1, b"hello"), (42, b"world"), (1, b"x" * 200000)])
out = stream.mux_load(m)                                  # [(1, b"hello"), ...]

# Document-in-document
outer = stream.embed_document(bovnar.dumps({"v": 1}), key="payload")
inner = stream.parse_embedded(bovnar.loads(outer)["payload"])   # {"v": 1}
```

`stream.BVNR_FILESIZE_UNLIMITED` (`== 0`) selects endless mode for
**`max_file_size`** only. Note it does **not** lift the framing/mux guards:
for `max_document_size` and `max_message`, `0` selects their finite defaults
(`BVNR_DOC_DEFAULT_MAX` / `BVNR_MUX_DEFAULT_MAX`), so pass an explicit large
value there to raise them. See [Python Bindings](4_bovnar_python_bindings.md)
and `python/tests/test_stream.py`.

---

## 6. Composition

The four compose cleanly because they live at different layers:

- A **frame stream** (2) can carry documents that each **embed** sub-documents (4).
- A **multiplexed** octet stream (3) is itself just one value in a document, which
  can be one frame in a frame stream (2).
- Any of the above is **endless** (1) by default (`max_file_size` 0 ==
  `BVNR_FILESIZE_UNLIMITED`); set a positive `max_file_size` to impose a cap.

Because each is a thin application over the public event API, you can also write
your own consumer/producer at the same seam without touching the core.
