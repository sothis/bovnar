check_web_links.py — every internal link in the published site resolves.

The gap this closes: bvnr_html_docs verifies the generated pages are FRESH, not
that their links go anywhere. gen_html_docs rewrites an inter-doc Markdown link
to its HTML page via SRC_TO_SLUG, and a document with no HTML page fell through
with the relative href the Markdown wrote — so "07_bovnar_unit_ambiguities.md" on
/docs/units/ resolved to /docs/units/07_bovnar_unit_ambiguities.md and 404'd, on three
pages, while the file served fine one directory away at /doc/. Nothing in the
suite noticed, because every page was perfectly up to date with its source.

What it checks, over web/**/*.{html,md}, web/sitemap.xml and the manifest:

  * the target exists under the web root (following web/doc -> ../doc);
  * it will actually REACH the server — that is, git tracks it, or a generator
    produces it (the PDFs into build/doc/pdf/, a language edition into web/<lang>/).
    Resolving against the disk instead passed here and failed in CI, because
    web/de/ is git-ignored: the answer has to be the same from any checkout;
  * it is not one of publish_web.sh's EXCLUDES — a file that exists locally but
    is deliberately NOT uploaded is still a 404 on the live site, which is the
    one class of dead link that looks fine from a checkout;
  * a "#fragment" resolves to an id on the target page (HTML), or to a heading
    slug (Markdown), so a renamed section is caught as well as a moved file.

The EXCLUDES list is PARSED from publish_web.sh rather than restated here: two
copies of that list would drift, and the drift would silently switch this check
off for whatever moved.

External hosts are reported but never fetched — a test must not depend on the
network.

Usage:
    python3 check_web_links.py            # report and exit 1 on any dead link
    python3 check_web_links.py --verbose  # also list what was checked

# Paths publish_web.sh CREATES at stage time instead of taking from web/: the
# PDFs are generated into build/doc/pdf/ (git-ignored) and copied into the
# staging tree. They are live URLs, so the links to them are not dead — but they
# are also not in a checkout, so they have to be resolved against the build
# directory rather than the web root. When it has not been built the links are
# reported as unverifiable rather than passed silently: publish_web.sh already
# refuses to ship without them ("the download links will 404"), so the existence
# question is gated there, and the question HERE is whether a page names a file
# the generator actually produces.

# The question this check has to answer is "will the server have this file?", and
# the answer must not depend on whose machine is asking. The site is committed
# files PLUS generated ones, and a generated file that happens to be sitting in
# the working tree is invisible to a fresh clone -- so resolving against the disk
# alone passes locally and fails in CI, which is the worst behaviour a gate can
# have. It did exactly that: web/de/ is git-ignored (gen_i18n.py writes it, and
# publish_web.sh runs that before staging), so the landing page's link to /de/
# resolved here and 404'd on a clean checkout.
#
# Everything below therefore resolves against `git ls-files` and an explicit list
# of generated prefixes, never against mere presence on disk.
#
# A language edition is legitimate only when its translation table exists -- the
