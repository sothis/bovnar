# runner-shortage.sh — did a run fail only because GitHub had no runner for some jobs?
#
# A job GitHub never starts ("The job was not acquired by Runner of type hosted even
# after multiple attempts", as when macOS arm64 runners are short) ends cancelled, and
# the jobs that need it are skipped. Re-running the failed jobs is then all it takes;
# the release of 2.0.1 needed five attempts for that alone. The runner-shortage
# workflow asks this script and re-runs only on "retry".
#
# Anything else keeps the run as it is: a job that failed, one cancelled by a newer
# push or by hand (no such annotation), and a branch run whose branch has moved on --
# re-running it would join the branch's concurrency group and cancel the newer run.
# A tag run is retried as long as the tag exists: tag runs are never cancelled.
#
#   .github/scripts/runner-shortage.sh OWNER/REPO RUN_ID [ATTEMPT]
#
# ATTEMPT is the run attempt to judge (default: the latest); the workflow passes the
# one that just completed.
#
# Prints "retry", or "keep: <reason>". Needs gh, authenticated for actions and checks.
