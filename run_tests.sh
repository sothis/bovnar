# run_tests.sh — build, then run EVERY registered test, then sweep the fuzzers.
#
# THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT KEEP A LIST OF TESTS, and that is the point. It used to:
# a hand-written sequence of run_test/run_cli_test/run_cmake_check calls that was
# a second copy of the CTest registry, maintained by remembering to. It drifted,
# the way a second copy of anything drifts — 81 line items here against 157
# registered tests, and the whole of it invisible from the inside, because a
# runner that never knew about a test cannot report it missing. Everything the
# seven unit-profile suites check, every documentation and web gate, the ABI
# dump, the amalgamation checks, the WASM freshness stamp and two thirds of the
# CLI corpus ran only under `ctest` and were reported as "All tests passed" here.
#
# So the corpus is now CTest's, run whole and unfiltered, and this script is what
# CTest is not:
#
#   * it BUILDS first, so "the tests pass" cannot mean "the tests as they were";
#   * it sweeps the fuzz harnesses at an iteration count you choose, where the
#     registered fuzz tests are pinned to fixed ones;
#   * it drives a cross-built (MinGW) tree through Wine;
#   * it ASSERTS that the number of tests run equals the number registered, so a
#     filter — including this script's own --no-fuzz — cannot quietly shrink the
#     run.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_tests.sh [--build-dir DIR] [--fuzz-iter N] [--no-fuzz] [-j N]
