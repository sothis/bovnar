# publish_web.sh — deploy the Bovnar website (everything under ./web) to the
# live server's web root with rsync.
#
# The web/doc directory is a symlink to ../doc (the canonical Markdown sources).
# This script stages the site into a temp directory, *resolving that symlink* so
# the docs land as real files under <webroot>/doc — never as a dangling link.
#
# Only the documents named in the WEBDOCS table below are published out of doc/.
# Anything else there — working notes, drafts, papers under submission — stays
# private without needing to be listed anywhere. Add a document to WEBDOCS to
# publish it; that is the only step.
#
# The documentation PDFs and the bovnar-docs-pdf.zip bundle are NOT kept in the
# repository; they are generated under build/doc/pdf/ (git-ignored). Pass --pdf
# to (re)build them with gen_doc_pdfs.py before uploading. Without --pdf the
# script ships whatever already exists in build/doc/pdf/ (and warns if empty).
#
# Usage:
#   ./publish_web.sh [options] [user@host:/var/www/html]
#
# The destination may be given as the last argument, or via the
# BOVNAR_PUBLISH_DEST environment variable. The argument wins if both are set.
#
# Options:
#   --pdf            Regenerate the doc PDFs + zip bundle before publishing.
#   --delete         Pass --delete to rsync (prune files removed locally).
#   -n, --dry-run    Show what rsync would transfer; do not build or upload.
#   -h, --help       Show this help and exit.
#
# Examples:
#   ./publish_web.sh me@bovnar.org:/var/www/html
#   ./publish_web.sh --pdf me@bovnar.org:/var/www/html
#   ./publish_web.sh --pdf --delete me@bovnar.org:/var/www/html

# ── What gets published out of doc/ ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# web/doc is a symlink to ../doc, so everything in doc/ used to reach the live
# site by default and each thing that should not was subtracted afterwards. That
# is the wrong way round for a directory that holds working documents next to
# published ones: the German Wikipedia draft, the Internet-Draft and the JOSS
# paper each shipped -- or would have -- until someone noticed and added a line.
# The JOSS paper actually did, and sat readable at /doc/joss_paper/paper.md.
#
# So doc/ is now allowlisted: nothing under it is published unless it is named
# here. A new working document in doc/ is private by default, and forgetting
# this table means a document is missing from the site -- loud, and the right
# way for it to fail -- rather than a private draft being world-readable, which
# is silent and the wrong way.
#
# Entries are paths relative to doc/ and may name a file or a directory. The
# PDFs are NOT here: they are generated into build/doc/pdf/ and dropped into the
# staging tree separately (step 2 below).
