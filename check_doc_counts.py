check_doc_counts.py — every "180 physical units" in the tree, against gendata.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. src/gendata is the source of truth for the catalogue, and
this repo gates the tables against it thoroughly: check_doc_unit_tables.py
compares roughly 1150 documented ROWS, test_unit_factors_derived.py compares the
generated C factors, check_profile_factors.py compares the profiles against
their publishers. What none of them compares is the SENTENCE — the headline
number a reader meets first, in the README, in the cheatsheet's scope line, in
the IETF draft, in the JOSS paper, in the EBNF's commentary, on the website.

Those had drifted, and drifted quietly, because a count in prose is invisible to
every table check. The registry had grown past 180 units and fifteen files still
said 180; the spelling total was stated as 529 against an actual 586. A reader
implementing from the draft, or citing the paper, got a number this repository
could have contradicted from its own data.

WHAT IS CHECKED. Only tightly anchored phrases — "N physical units", "N accepted
spellings", "N fiat currencies" and the handful of others in CLAIMS below. Each
is a phrase whose subject is unambiguous, so a number that happens to sit near
the word "unit" ("180 square Ruten", "216 bytes") is not swept up. A file with
no such phrase is not a failure: this proves the numbers that ARE stated, it
does not require any to be.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED. CHANGELOG.md and the release notes, which are
a record of what was true at a version and must not be rewritten; web/ and dist/,
which are generated from the documents checked here.

Usage:  python3 check_doc_counts.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when every stated count matches src/gendata, 1 with a list when not.
