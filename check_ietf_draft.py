check_ietf_draft.py — the IETF draft and the documentation set say what the
header says.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. doc/ietf/draft-sonntag-bovnar-00 is a second, independent
statement of the format, written for a different audience and rendered into four
committed artifacts (.md, .txt, .xml, .html). Nothing compared it to anything.
check_doc_refs.py checks that citations RESOLVE and that the spec's error table
matches include/bovnar.h; check_doc_layout.py checks structure. Neither looks at
the draft at all, and neither checks a numeric CLAIM anywhere.

So the draft drifted, and so did doc/05: both said a compound unit may not exceed
"8 components" long after BVNR_MAX_UNIT_COMPONENTS became 32. doc/03 said 32. A
reader implementing from the draft would have rejected documents the reference
implementation accepts -- an interoperability defect, in the one document whose
entire purpose is interoperability.

WHAT IS CHECKED, AND WHY EACH ONE. Every check here is a fact stated in two
places that only the header can settle:

  * ERROR CODES. Every error_* the draft names must exist in error_code_t, and
    every code in error_code_t must be named by the draft. The first direction
    catches a typo or a renamed code; the second catches a new code the draft was
    never told about, which is how a normative document quietly stops being
    normative.

  * NUMERIC LIMITS. The draft's limits table and doc/05's, against the constants
    they cite. This is the check that would have caught the 8/32 drift on the
    commit that introduced it.

  * EPOCH NAMES and TYPE FAMILIES. Enumerations a consumer must implement
    exactly; a missing one is a document that cannot be implemented from.

  * SPEC VERSION. The draft describes a numbered specification; if the build's
    BVNR_SPEC_VERSION moves past it, the draft needs a new revision rather than
    silently describing an older format.

  * RENDERING AGREEMENT. The .txt, .xml and .html are generated from the .md by
    kramdown-rfc/xml2rfc, which are not run here and not in CI. A fix applied to
    the .md alone would leave three committed artifacts stating the old value, so
    every fact checked above is re-checked in each rendering. This is the check
    that makes "fix the draft" mean all four files.

WHAT IT COMPARES, AND WHY THE SET GREW. It began with the error-code enum and
the component limit -- the two things that had drifted. The EXPONENT RANGE was
added after doc/03 and all three renderings of the draft were found describing
the caret form as "one digit 1-9", the range unit_exponent_t had before it grew
to [-100, 100]: a parser built from either document rejects `m^100`, which this
library emits as the canonical spelling of exponent 100. A specification that
cannot describe its own reference implementation's output is the sharpest form
this failure takes.

The document set grew for the same reason. The tutorial's worked "too many
components" example and the bindings reference's account of the pint bridge were
both stating the old numbers, so the non-normative documents are checked too --
without the requirement to STATE a limit, since only the normative ones have
that duty, but with every figure they do state compared.
