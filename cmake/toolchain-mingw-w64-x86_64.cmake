# CMake toolchain file for cross-compiling the 64-bit MinGW-w64 Windows build
# from a Linux host (mirrors the MINGW64 leg of .github/workflows/build-and-package.yml,
# which builds natively under MSYS2). Use it for a local cross-build:
#
#   cmake -B build/mingw -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake \
#         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBVNR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF .
#   cmake --build build/mingw
#
# Produces libbvnr.a, libbvnr.dll (+ libbvnr.dll.a import lib) and bovnar.exe.
# Tests stay OFF: the harness is POSIX (fork/exec, socketpair/pthread, sigaction)
# and there is no Wine/Windows runtime on the host to execute the .exe locally;
# this leg verifies the cross-build compiles and links.
