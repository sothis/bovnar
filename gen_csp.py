"""Compute and stamp a hash-based Content-Security-Policy into the served pages.

The Bovnar site is static and self-hosted, with no server-side templating, so a
per-request nonce is impossible. Every inline <script> is therefore pinned by the
SHA-256 of its own bytes: the CSP lists 'sha256-...' for each, and the browser
recomputes and compares. No 'unsafe-inline' for scripts — an injected inline
script (or an onerror handler smuggled through the Markdown the doc drawer
renders into innerHTML) has no matching hash and does not run.

The hashes change whenever an inline script is edited, so this file is the tool
that recomputes them and cmake/csp.cmake (via --check) fails the suite when the
stamped policy no longer matches the scripts it is meant to authorise — the same
anti-drift discipline the ?v= cache stamps and the WASM artifact already have.

  ./gen_csp.py           rewrite the CSP <meta> in index.html, impressum.html, 404.html
  ./gen_csp.py --check   verify only; exit non-zero on drift

The translated editions carry ONE extra inline script (the __BVNR_I18N__ boot
blob gen_i18n.py injects). gen_i18n.py imports script_hashes()/build_meta() from
here and adds that hash when it writes web/<lang>/index.html, so the tooling for
the policy lives in one place.
