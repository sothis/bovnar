check_doc_refs.py — every "§N.M" a comment cites points at a section that exists.

The code cites the documentation constantly: a test explains what it pins with
"doc/08 §1.11 promises …", a header points at "the spec, §\"Version directive\"".
Those citations are the only thing tying a subtle test back to the sentence that
made it a requirement, and nothing checked them — so they rot in two directions.

Renumbering rots them wholesale. doc/08 numbered its function sections 1-25
straight through, was renumbered to N.M, and every "§7c" in the test suite
quietly began pointing at nothing; the documents' own links were all verified,
which is exactly why it went unnoticed. And they rot one at a time: a comment
cited "spec §501", which was never a section number, and another quoted a doc/05
heading — "An affine unit is valid at exponent 1 only" — that the document does
not contain, in either case describing a rule that is really there under a
number the reader cannot follow.

What a citation may look like, and how the target document is resolved:

    spec §7.4                 -> doc/03          (also "specification")
    doc/08 §1.11               -> doc/08          (a "doc/N" anywhere before it)
    read/write API §1.10      -> doc/08          (a name cue -- see CUES)
    §11 of [Unit Ambiguities] -> 07_bovnar_unit_ambiguities.md  (a cue right after it)
    §13.2                     -> the spec, from source; from inside doc/X, that
                                 same document -- which is what every bare "§"
                                 in the tree means today, and now the rule.
    §"Version directive"      -> a quoted name, matched case-insensitively
                                 against the document's text

A citation to an external standard (IEEE 754 §3.5.2, ISO 8601 §4.2) or to
somebody's licence (UCUM §3(a), CC BY 4.0 §2(a)(1)) is left alone: the skip list
is what tells those apart from a citation into doc/.

THE REPOSITORY ROOT WAS NOT SCANNED, and for a long time nobody noticed, because
the root held little that cited a section. It does now -- README, CONTRIBUTING,
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and the two CMakeLists between them carry citations into
doc/, and a deliberately broken §99.4 in any of them passed this gate. The root
is scanned now, non-recursively (its subdirectories are already covered by
SEARCH_DIRS or are build output), with two files skipped whole and a marker for
the individual lines that must not be resolved:

  * CHANGELOG.md cites section numbers AS THEY WERE WHEN THE ENTRY WAS WRITTEN.
    doc/08's renumbering is itself a changelog entry, and "carrying the citations
    over" there would mean rewriting history to match today's numbering --
    check_doc_counts.py skips it for exactly this reason and says so.
  * This file documents bad citations as examples -- §7c and §501 above are the
    two real ones it was built to catch -- so scanning itself reports its own
    documentation as defects.
  * `bovnar:no-section-check` on a line exempts the citations on that line, for
    the two cases a file-level skip is too blunt for: a comment that NARRATES a
    dead citation ("spec §501", never a section number), and a citation into a
    document this checker does not index, such as the IETF draft under doc/ietf.
    It is the same "a marker that looks like a comment is really configuration"
    convention as `bovnar:retired-path`, and it is deliberately per-line: a whole
    file waived is a file that stops being checked.

The same rot reaches a table that quotes source. The spec's §16.10 reprints the
error_code_t enum, and nothing compared it to include/bovnar.h — so it stopped
at 48 while the header had run to 51, and §11.9 named two of the three missing
codes in its own outcome table, leaving the document contradicting itself three
sections apart. The gap had a sharper edge than a stale list: §17 promises new
codes are appended above the current maximum, so a reader implementing from the
spec would have assigned 49 on top of a code that already existed. The enum is
checked here for the same reason the citations are — it is a claim about the
tree that only the tree can settle.

    python3 check_doc_refs.py            # report and exit 1 on a dead citation

# conversion reports through, in the document about units.

# enforces and what is there for symmetry with the reader -- both clearer than
# declaration order, and both signposted. An ellipsis comment inside the braces
