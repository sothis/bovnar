check_citation.py — CITATION.cff is a schema-valid CFF 1.2 file.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. CITATION.cff is read by machines and by nobody else: GitHub's
"Cite this repository" button, Zenodo's deposit form, cffconvert rendering BibTeX
or APA. When it is wrong they do not report an error to the repository — they
degrade, or fall back, or drop a field, and the repository looks fine from the
inside. That is exactly what happened here: one line, `abbreviation: BVNR`, sat at
the TOP LEVEL of the file, where CFF 1.2 sets `additionalProperties: false`. The
key is real and legal — inside a `references:` entry. At the top level it made the
whole document fail validation, silently, for as long as it was there.

It matters more now than it did, because that file no longer only says who to cite:
its `references:` block carries the machine-readable attribution for the six unit
vocabularies whose identifiers this project ships (THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md, doc/11
§18). Attribution that fails to parse is attribution nobody receives.

WHY THIS DOES NOT USE A SCHEMA VALIDATOR. cffconvert and jsonschema would check
far more than this does, and neither can be a test dependency: every gate in this
repository runs on a clean checkout with Python 3 and a C compiler, no network and
no pip. So this checks the one axis that actually broke, and checks it exactly:
the set of keys at the top level, against the CFF 1.2 allow-list, plus the three
keys every `references:` entry is required to carry. It is a spelling checker, not
a schema validator, and it says so rather than implying a completeness it has not
got. A full validation stays a manual step:

    pip install cffconvert && cffconvert --validate -i CITATION.cff

WHY NOT PyYAML. It is not a dependency of anything else here, and the structure
this needs is trivially visible without it: a top-level key is a key at column 0,
and a reference entry is a `- ` item under `references:`. Parsing YAML properly to
find out whether a line starts at column 0 would add a dependency to answer a
question the bytes already answer.

    THE ONE THING THIS HAS TO GET RIGHT IS NESTING, and the first version did
    not: it treated every `- ` line as a new entry, so the `- name:` items inside
    an entry's own `authors:` list each became an entry of their own -- and every
    one of those "entries" was of course missing type, title and authors. The
    file was valid and this said it was broken nine times over.

    So the item indent is fixed by the FIRST `- ` seen under `references:` and
    only that indent starts an entry; anything deeper belongs to the entry above.
