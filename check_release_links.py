check_release_links.py — the site's Downloads menu points at the newest release.

The landing page's nav carries a Downloads menu whose six links go straight to
the GitHub release assets. Those assets cannot be named generically: CI packs
them as `bovnar-<version>-<count>-…`, where <count> is the tagged commit's total
commit count, so there is no name-agnostic URL GitHub would redirect. The menu
is therefore pinned to a tag by hand — and a hand-written URL set that has to be
retyped at every release is precisely the thing that gets forgotten. Forgotten
here it is silent: the links keep resolving, keep downloading, and keep handing
out the PREVIOUS version to everyone who takes the site at its word.

So this recomputes what the release job would have produced and compares:

  * the newest v* tag is the one the menu links to;
  * every asset filename matches what pack_artifacts.cmake names for that tag's
    version and commit count -- derived the way the packer derives them, from
    project() in CMakeLists.txt AT THE TAG and `git rev-list --count <tag>`,
    not from the tag string, so a tag cut without bumping project() is caught
    too (that mismatch would name every archive after the old version);
  * the version the panel prints in its heading is that same tag.

What it deliberately does not check: the human-readable sizes beside each link.
They are not derivable without asking github.com, and a test here must not
depend on the network (the same rule check_web_links.py works under). A stale
size mislabels a download; a stale URL ships the wrong software.

Note the ordering this implies when cutting a release: tag first, let CI build
and attach the archives, then update the menu. Updating the page first fails
here, and rightly -- until the tag exists those files do not.

Usage:
    python3 check_release_links.py            # exit non-zero on drift
    python3 check_release_links.py --verbose  # also print what matched
