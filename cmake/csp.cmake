# Does the stamped Content-Security-Policy still authorise the page's scripts?
#
# The policy pins every inline <script> by the SHA-256 of its bytes (there is no
# server to mint a nonce). Edit a script and its hash changes, so a stamped
# policy silently stops matching -- and the browser then BLOCKS that script,
# breaking the page for everyone, with the failure visible only in a console
# nobody watches. gen_csp.py recomputes the policy; this fails the suite when the
# committed pages have drifted from it. It shells out to the same Python so there
# is one implementation of the hashing, not a second one to keep in sync.
