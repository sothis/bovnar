check_profile_factors.py — prove the profile tables against their publishers.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. gen_profiles.py checks that every `.bovnar` target names
something the native registry has, and the per-profile test files check that a
code translates to the unit the table says. Neither checks the table against the
publication the codes come from, and doc/11 §9.2, §10.2 and §10.4 all say so:
five tables wrong in the same way would agree with each other perfectly. This is
the missing half. It reads the publisher's own machine-readable definitions,
resolves each code to a factor and a dimension vector, asks the REFERENCE
LIBRARY what the mapped native target is worth, and compares.

It found, on the tree it was written against: udunits' `oz` mapped to the
avoirdupois ounce when UDUNITS defines it as the US fluid ounce (a volume read
as a mass), the unqualified `calorie` mapped to the thermochemical one when
UDUNITS means the IT calorie, `year`/`month` mapped to the Julian year when
UDUNITS means the tropical one, and `acre`/`chain`/`rod`/`furlong` mapped onto
international lengths when UDUNITS builds them on the US survey foot. Extending
it to QUDT found six local names that vocabulary does not define, a month that
was the lunar one, and a rotational speed 2π out.

WHY IT ASKS THE LIBRARY RATHER THAN COMPUTING THE NATIVE SIDE ITSELF. A second
implementation of the native unit grammar in Python is exactly how a generated
table starts disagreeing with the parser it feeds — gen_profiles.py's own header
says this. So the native side of every comparison goes through bvn_parse_unit
and bvn_unit_to_si_factor via the ctypes bindings. If those are wrong this tool
cannot see it; what it can see is the table disagreeing with the publisher,
which is the failure mode nothing else covers.

THREE OUTCOMES, AND ONLY TWO ARE ERRORS.

  MISMATCH   the code exists upstream and means something else — a different
             dimension, or a factor outside tolerance. This is the one that
             corrupts data silently, and it fails the run.
  DEAD       the table accepts a spelling the publisher does not define. It can
             never be produced by a conforming producer, so it costs nothing but
             an unverifiable row. Reported, not fatal (--strict-dead to change).
  MISSING    the publisher defines a code that is EXACTLY a native unit and the
             table does not map it. Advisory: it is a coverage suggestion, not a
             defect, and the decision to carry a unit is editorial.

AND ONE COMPARISON THAT IS NOT A NUMBER AT ALL. Everything above compares a
factor and a dimension vector, and a dimension vector has no room for a QUANTITY
KIND: a bit, a radian, a steradian, a decibel and a pure ratio are all
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and a bit per second and a hertz are both T⁻¹ at factor 1. So a
mapping could turn a data rate into a frequency and score perfectly here. It
did, seven times over, until `check_quantity_kinds` was added — see the note on
that function. It uses QUDT's own unit-to-quantity-kind links to check the two
QUDT tables against each other, on the one axis the factor comparison is blind
to, and a disagreement there fails the run like a MISMATCH.

AND ONE THAT COMPARES TWO BOVNAR TABLES RATHER THAN A TABLE AND A PUBLISHER.
Everything above asks whether one of these tables agrees with the vocabulary it
came from. A defect can survive that by being consistent within its own
vocabulary: QUDT models the international unit as an amount of substance
throughout, so nothing internal to QUDT objects to `IU-PER-MilliGM` becoming
µmol/kg — while UCUM, and bovnar's own ucum table, hold [IU] to be arbitrary and
commensurable with nothing. `check_cross_reference` uses QUDT's published
ucumCode/udunitsCode as a claim that two rows in two different bovnar tables
describe one unit, and checks that they do. It found three defects the other two
could not.

ALL SEVEN PROFILES ARE COVERED, BUT NOT ALL EQUALLY. `ucum`, `udunits`, `qudt`,
`qudt-qk`, `om` and `cf` are checked against their publishers' own definitions.
`unece` is checked at ONE REMOVE, through QUDT's `qudt:uneceCommonCode`
cross-reference, because Rec 20 states its conversion factors in prose and there
is no primary artefact to resolve. That is QUDT asserting what a Rec 20 code
means, so a disagreement there is evidence that one of the two tables is wrong,
never proof of which — `class Unece` says what follows from that, and the run
prints the distinction rather than letting a secondary result read like a
primary one.

THE FOUR RESOLVERS ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SHAPES, because the publishers are:

  expression   UCUM and UDUNITS state a unit as an expression over other units,
               so each needs a small evaluator.
  table        QUDT states every unit's own multiplier and dimension vector, so
               reading it is a lookup.
  composition  OM states no multiplier at all. It states how a unit is BUILT --
               prefix and base, numerator and denominator, term and term, base
               and exponent — and the value falls out of walking that down to
               the SI base units. `class Om` is that walk, and it is the same
               structure om.bvnr's targets were derived from, which is the point
               of checking it: a target and a value that came from one reading
               of the ontology are compared against the library's independent
               reading of the target.
  two sources  CF states no units either; it states each standard name's
               `canonical_units` as a UDUNITS expression. So `class Cf` reads
               CF's table for the name and hands the string to the UDUNITS
               evaluator above. Both publishers are primary, and neither is
               being asked about the other's vocabulary.

Arbitrary and special units (UCUM `isArbitrary`/`isSpecial`, QUDT units with no
`conversionMultiplier`) have no factor to check and are skipped — they are
exactly the ones bovnar carries as opaque or refuses outright.

QUDT NEEDS NO EVALUATOR. UCUM and UDUNITS state a unit as an EXPRESSION over
other units, so both need a parser; QUDT states each unit's own
`conversionMultiplier` and its dimension vector as an IRI local name
("A0E0L1I0M0H0T0D0"), so reading it is a table lookup. Its quantity kinds have
no multiplier at all, and there the check is the claim doc/11 §12.3 actually
makes: that a kind maps to the COHERENT SI unit of that kind. Reporting a kind
as (1.0, its dimensions) turns that into two ordinary assertions — the
dimensions agree and the native factor is exactly 1 — so a kind mapped to a
non-coherent unit fails on the factor even though its dimensions are perfect.

THE TWO UNIT SYSTEMS ARE NOT THE SAME SYSTEM, and the corrections below are the
substance of the UCUM comparison rather than a detail of it:

  * UCUM's mass base is the GRAM; bovnar's factors are coherent SI, i.e. kg. A
    UCUM factor is divided by 1000^(mass exponent).
  * UCUM has no amount base — the mole is a NUMBER, Avogadro's. Anything with a
    mole in it therefore carries N_A that the bovnar factor does not, so the
    UCUM factor is divided by N_A^(amount exponent), using UCUM's OWN value of
    N_A so it cancels exactly rather than to fifteen digits.
  * UCUM's electrical base is CHARGE (dim Q); bovnar's is current. Q maps to
    current+1 and time+1, which is what makes `A` = `C/s` come out as a bare
    current and `C` as current·time.
  * UCUM's plane angle (dim A) is a base; bovnar's radian is dimensionless. The
    A component is dropped, which is what lets `rad`, `sr` and `deg` compare.

LENGTH, MASS, TIME, CURRENT, TEMP, AMOUNT, LUM = range(NDIM)

# Relative tolerance for a factor comparison, CALIBRATED against the two
# publishers rather than picked round.
#
# A publisher states decimals, and states them at whichever CODATA edition it was
# last revised against: UDUNITS writes the horsepower as 7.456999e2 W and the
# atomic mass unit at the 1986 adjustment, UCUM states that unit at 2018, and
# units.bvnr states it at 2022 (its header names the edition). So a correct row
# still disagrees in the seventh digit or so. Across all five tables every such
# disagreement lands at or below 6.81e-7. The genuine errors this tool was
# written to catch are above it: the US survey foot at 2e-6, the survey acre at
# 4e-6, the tropical year at 2.1e-5, the IT calorie at 6.7e-4.
#
# The gap is MUCH NARROWER than the survey foot suggests, and pretending
# otherwise would be the dangerous mistake here. UCUM's [ch_br] -- the BRITISH
# chain, built on a foot that differs from the international one in the seventh
# digit -- sits 7.87e-7 from bovnar's international chain. That is a genuinely
# different unit, and at a tolerance of 1e-6 it passed as a match. The real
# boundary is therefore:
#
#     largest publisher rounding seen     6.81e-7   (UDUNITS' 1986 CODATA amu
#                                                    against bovnar's 2022 one)
#     smallest genuine difference seen    7.87e-7   (British vs international)
#
# 7.5e-7 is the only value that separates them, and it separates them by 10 %.
# This is a measurement, not a margin: a real disagreement below 6.8e-7 -- the
# British/international foot ratio applied to a shorter chain, say -- would
# still pass. Nothing better is available without tracking each publisher's
# stated precision through its whole definition chain, which is the honest
# limit of a factor comparison against a source that publishes decimals.
TOL = 7.5e-7

# Differences that are MODELLING choices rather than errors. bovnar carries bit
# and byte as two base units of information with no factor between them; UCUM
# and UDUNITS both define the byte as the number 8, which is a different and
# equally defensible model, not a wrong conversion.
#
# QUDT goes further than the other two: it models information as ENTROPY, so its
# bit is ln(2) = 0.693 and its byte 8·ln(2) = 5.545, the SI-coherent unit of
# entropy being the nat. bovnar's bit is 1. qudt-qk.bvnr already refuses
# `InformationEntropy` for exactly this reason.
#
# THE WHOLE QUDT INFORMATION FAMILY IS THAT ONE DIFFERENCE, REPEATED. Every row
# below is a prefixed bit or byte, a rate of one, or a linear density of one,
# and each is off the native target by exactly ln 2 or 8·ln 2 — never by
# anything else. Listing them by name rather than widening the tolerance is
# deliberate: the ratio is 0.693, so a tolerance that admitted it would admit
# every real disagreement in the file. A row that stops being off by exactly the
# model factor stops being waived and fails, which is the property that matters.

    Unlike QUDT, OM does not state a multiplier per unit. It states how the unit
    is BUILT -- a PrefixedUnit's prefix and base, a UnitDivision's numerator and
    denominator, a UnitMultiplication's two terms, a UnitExponentiation's base
    and exponent, a SingularUnit's factor against the unit it is defined from --
    and a value falls out of walking that structure down to the SI base units.
    So this resolver is a small evaluator, like the UCUM and UDUNITS ones and
    unlike the QUDT table read.

    A named unit states its definition as `hasUnit` with NO factor: the joule IS
    the newton metre, the becquerel IS the reciprocal second. That case is what
    makes the coherent derived units resolve to 1 without a list of them here.

    A unit OM gives a dimension and no definition at all -- calorie-15C,
    InternationalUnit, the currencies -- resolves to None and is skipped, which
    is right: those are exactly the rows om.bvnr refuses.

    A standard name has no factor of its own. What it has is a
    `canonical_units` field, and that field is a UDUNITS expression -- CF's unit
    syntax is UDUNITS -- so the check is: evaluate the name's canonical_units
    with the same evaluator the udunits profile is checked against, and compare
    it with what the library says cf.bvnr's target is worth.

    Both sides are primary. This is not the one-remove position `unece` is in:
    CF publishes the name-to-units mapping itself, and Unidata publishes what
    the units are worth, so a disagreement found here is a defect in cf.bvnr
    rather than evidence about a third party's cross-reference.

    Three canonical_units strings resolve to None and are skipped, each for a
    reason the udunits profile already has: `degree_C` is affine, `dB` is
    logarithmic, and `W m-2 sr-1 (m-1)-1` uses a parenthesised negative exponent
    the UDUNITS evaluator here does not implement. The first two have no factor
    to compare in any case.

    ALIASES ARE NOT SPELLINGS. CF's deprecated names live in `<alias>` elements
    and cf.bvnr deliberately carries none of them, so they are kept out of
    `spellings()` too: reporting 599 absent aliases as a coverage gap would be
    proposing exactly what that file refuses to do.

    Gy and Sv -- collapse onto whichever comes first, which is why a suggestion
    is advisory: it says "this code is worth what some native unit is worth",
    not "map it to that one".

    THE BARE SYMBOLS ARE NOT ENOUGH, and this is the half that matters for

    be missing while its neighbours carry them.

    So every `.bovnar` target any of the five profile tables already uses is

                                     said so plainly.
      qudt:IU-PER-MilliGM -> µmol/kg QUDT models the international unit as an
                                     amount of substance and is self-consistent
                                     about it, so nothing internal to QUDT could
                                     object. Its ucumCode is "[IU].mg-1", and

                                     commensurable with nothing. One library,
                                     two answers for one quantity.
      qudt:S_Ab -> a conductivity    QUDT gives the absiemens the dimension

    A cross-reference is EVIDENCE, not proof — the same standing `class Unece`
    has, and for the same reason: a disagreement says one of the two tables is
    wrong, never which. Seventeen of them are QUDT's own (a code that reads
    "TW/h" for the terawatt-hour, "d/Cel" for the gram per degree Celsius, a

    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Every other comparison in this file is a NUMBER
    against a NUMBER: the publisher's factor and dimension vector against the
    native target's. That cannot see a quantity kind, because a kind is exactly
    what a dimension vector has no room for — a bit, a radian, a steradian, a
    decibel and a pure ratio are all [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and a bit per second and a
    hertz are both T⁻¹ at factor 1. So a mapping could turn a data rate into a
    frequency, a bit density into a reciprocal length, or a radiance into an
    irradiance, and pass every check here with a perfect score.

    That is not hypothetical. It is what the tables did: qudt:ExaBIT-PER-SEC was
    E~Hz, qudt-qk:BitRate and ByteRate were Hz, BitTransmissionRate and
    ByteTransmissionRate were s⁻¹, LinearBitDensity was m⁻¹, DataRate was Hz,
    and PowerPerAreaAngle and TotalRadiance were W/m² beside a `Radiance` that
    correctly carried the steradian. Seven of them, each a unit the library's own
    bvn_units_convertible calls incompatible with the one it was standing in for.

    The check needs no new source. QUDT already states, for nearly every unit it
    defines, the quantity kind that unit measures (`qudt:hasQuantityKind`) — and
    bovnar maps both vocabularies. A kind translates to the COHERENT unit of the
