check_doc_profile_atoms.py — doc/11 §6.1's UCUM atom tables, against
src/gendata/ucum.bvnr.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. §6.1 opens with "What follows is the whole mapped list",
and it was not: 188 codes are mapped in `ucum.bvnr` and 155 appeared in the
tables, so a third of the profile was invisible to a reader consulting the one
place that promises completeness. Worse than an omission, the same section
carried a sentence saying the US survey series "is **refused**" while §6.3, a
hundred lines down, correctly listed all nine of them as mapped — the document
contradicting itself about a capability the library has had for some time.

Nothing caught it because the existing gates ask different questions.
check_profile_factors.py's `check_doc_error_claims` keys on an `error_unit_*`
token, and a sentence that says "is refused" in plain English carries none;
`check_doc_profile_spellings` reads what the WRITER emits. Neither asks the
completeness question, which is the one §6.1's own opening sentence makes.

WHAT IS CHECKED, per row of §6.1:

  membership  the code is one `ucum.bvnr` maps (an opaque/arbitrary unit is
              allowed too — §6.1 lists a few beside the mapped ones);
  target      the Bovnar column is what the reference implementation actually
              produces for `ucum:<code>` — not merely a unit that parses;
  factor      the third column is that unit's coherent-SI factor;
  coverage    every mapped code appears in some §6.1 table.

The whole-code table at the end of §6.1 is read the same way, except that its
first column holds a UCUM EXPRESSION rather than an atom, so it is checked by
parsing rather than by table membership.

Needs the built library (it asks the reader, rather than restating its rules),
so it skips rather than fails when there is none — the same rule
check_profile_factors.py follows.

Usage:  python3 check_doc_profile_atoms.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when §6.1 agrees with src/gendata and the library, 1 with a list when not.
