"""
The exact-rational renderer, checked against arithmetic rather than against
itself.

`converted_in_base(b)` renders an exact conversion in base b, or returns None
when it has no terminating expansion there. Both halves are decidable without
consulting the implementation:

  * a rational p/q in lowest terms terminates in base b exactly when every
    prime factor of q also divides b; and
  * when it does terminate, decoding the digits must give back p/q exactly.

The suite spot-checked one value in bases 2 and 16. This checks the rule itself
across every base the format writes, so a renderer that started truncating, or
started claiming a terminating expansion it could not produce, fails here rather
than in a document.
