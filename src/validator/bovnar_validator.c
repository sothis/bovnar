 * ===========================================================================
 * Validator (semantic layer)
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The lexer produces lexically valid tokens; the validator turns them into
 * meaning and enforces the type system. It sits behind the lexer and is fed
 * raw tokens (bvn_val_receive) and structural events (bvn_val_receive_event).
 *
 * Dual emission — the central design choice. Each value can be observed at two
 * stages via two independent callbacks:
 *
 *   on_unverified : fired the moment the lexer hands a token over, before any
 *                   semantic check. Lets a consumer see the raw token stream.
 *   on_verified   : fired only after type/range/unit checks pass, carrying the
 *                   resolved value_type and unit.
 *
 * One exception to "before any semantic check": read-time unit conversion. The
 * want_unit hook has to run before either callback — it may abort the parse, and
 * a value both callbacks then observe must not differ between them — so when it
 * is installed, the ev_data an on_unverified consumer sees already carries a
 * populated `converted`/`conv`. Everything else about that event is still the
 * pre-validation view.
 *
 * Tooling (the canonicaliser, the events demo) uses both to show the lexer and
 * validator views side by side; ordinary consumers usually set only
 * on_verified. The bvn_emit_unverified/_verified/_both helpers centralise the
 * "callback returned false => error_scanner_callback_failed" contract.
 *
 * Type inference — bovnar values may omit an explicit type annotation. When a
 * bare value arrives the validator infers a default family (uint/sint/float/
 * utf8/bool) from the literal's shape and *synthesises* the full annotation
 * event sequence (bvn_emit_default_type_annotation), so a downstream writer can
 * round-trip the value with an explicit type even though the input had none.
 *
 * Accumulator — bvn_acc_* incrementally fold a numeric literal into a uint64
 * while it is being parsed, tracking dot/exponent presence. This makes range
 * checking for <=64-bit types allocation-free; wider types fall back to the
 * arbitrary-precision validators in bovnar_utils.c.
 *
 * Caches — type annotations and inline units repeat heavily in real documents
 * (every element of a typed array, say). tcache/iucache are small FIFO caches
 * keyed on the raw annotation bytes so the comparatively expensive parse is
 * done once per distinct annotation rather than once per value.
