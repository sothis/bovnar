check_doc_unit_factors.py — the Factor column in doc/04 and doc/05, against
src/gendata/units.bvnr.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. check_doc_unit_tables.py compares roughly 1150 documented
rows against gendata and says so in its own header: "Not checked: the Factor
column. It is prose as much as data -- '10⁻⁴ m²·s⁻¹', '101 325/760 Pa',
'2π rad', '1/9 000 000 kg/m' -- and a parser for it would be guessing at
intent."

That reasoning is right about the guessing and wrong about the conclusion. The
Factor column is the one column a reader USES: it is where somebody looking up
`inHg` learns the number to multiply by, and it is the column that decides
whether the documentation and the library agree about what a unit IS. Leaving it
ungated left a 462-cell surface where the library could be corrected and the
reference could not notice — and it does not need a parser that guesses, because
the cells are not free prose. They are a small grammar with a long tail:

    a scaled unit product     0.0254 m · 10⁻³ m³ · 3.7×10¹⁰ Bq · 1/9 000 000 kg/m
    a bare unit product       kg·m·s⁻² · cd·sr·m⁻² · mol·s⁻¹
    an irrational multiple    π/180 rad · 2π rad · 1000/(4π) A/m
    an affine definition      K = (°F + 459.67) × 5/9
    a temperature interval    5/9 K exactly
    prose                     SI base unit of time · reactive power; same SI dim as W

So the grammar is implemented, every cell that matches it is EVALUATED and
compared against the catalogue in exact rational arithmetic (with π carried
symbolically), and every cell that does not match must be one of the prose forms
in PROSE below. A cell that is neither is a failure — which is what stops the
"unparseable, so skipped" hole from re-opening one cell at a time.

WHAT IS COMPARED. The evaluated cell against `.factor` (and, for the affine
rows, against `.offset` too), plus the DIMENSION the cell's own unit product
implies against `.dims`. That second check is the one that catches a factor that
is numerically right and physically mislabelled — `10⁻⁴ T` for the gauss is only
correct because a tesla is kg·A⁻¹·s⁻², and if the row said `10⁻⁴ Wb` the number
would still be 10⁻⁴.

EXACTNESS IS COMPARED TOO, not just the value. A cell that says "(exact)" for a
unit units.bvnr marks `.exact = false` is a wrong claim about losslessness even
when the digits agree, and vice versa; both directions fail here.

doc/07's own claims — which tokens resolve, which are refused, and which units
share a dimension — are a different question about a different document, and
live in check_doc_ambiguities.py.

Usage:  python3 check_doc_unit_factors.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when every checked cell agrees with src/gendata, 1 with a list when not.
