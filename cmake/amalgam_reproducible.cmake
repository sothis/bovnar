# Does the amalgamation depend on WHERE it was built?
#
# It must not. bvnr_wasm_freshness compares a hash of the amalgamated sources
# against a stamp committed by wasm/build_wasm.sh, so the moment the output
# varies with the build directory, that gate reports a stale artifact on a tree
# where nothing is stale -- and would report a fresh one only for whoever built
# in a directory named the same as the recorder's.
#
# This has been wrong twice. The banner comments that head each inlined fragment
# carry the fragment's path, and the generated ones live under <build>/generated;
# the first fix normalised a build tree OUTSIDE the source tree and one named
# exactly "build", which left `cmake -B build-asan` -- i.e. the sanitizer job --
# falling through with its directory name baked into the output.
#
# Build the amalgamation twice from byte-identical inputs, differing only in the
# name of the directory the generated fragments sit in, and require the two to
# match exactly.
