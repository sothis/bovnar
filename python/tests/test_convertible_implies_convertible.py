"""
`units_convertible` is a screen, and the gap between it and the conversion is
exactly one shape wide.

doc/05 §12.4 used to claim in one paragraph that `bvn_units_convertible` reports
"exactly the set `bvn_unit_convert_value` and `bvn_unit_convert_rational`
accept", and in the next that it is "a screen, not a guarantee -- `s/°C` passes
here and the conversion entry points still refuse it". The second paragraph was
right, and screening on the first cost three silent policy failures (a target
that claimed `°C/h -> K/h` and then delivered the °C/h value, and two rule modes
that reported OK on a document satisfying neither).

The document says the screen is a SUPERSET whose gap is exactly TWO shapes: an
affine scale outside "alone, at exponent 1", and capacity — a factor needing
more than BVN_INT_MAX_BITS, which is why `Q~m^100 -> q~m^100` screens true and
then declines. That second one is deliberate and documented: separating "too
large to compute" from "these units disagree" is the question the screen exists
to answer.

The sweep below runs over the catalogue and its quotients and squares, a domain
that cannot reach the capacity bound, so within it the affine shape is the only
one permitted. `test_capacity_is_the_other_shape_in_the_gap` pins the second
directly. If a THIRD shape ever opens, a policy can start claiming values it
cannot deliver again, and the sentence in doc/05 quietly becomes false.
