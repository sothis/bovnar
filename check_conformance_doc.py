check_conformance_doc.py — doc/7's worked examples must be what the adapter emits.

doc/7 is the specification a third-party implementor works from: it states that
an implementation is conformant when its IUT adapter produces output
"byte-for-byte identical to the reference for every test case". The worked
examples are therefore normative in practice — they are what somebody copies.

Nothing checked them, and the suite structurally could not: bvnr_conformance_iut
compares the adapter's log against the reference's INTERNAL capture, and the two
formatters are line-for-line duplicates of each other. Both agreeing says nothing
about either matching the document. Four of the six examples were wrong:

  * TYPE_ANN_START / TYPE_FAMILY / TYPE_ANN_END were shown carrying the family
    keyword ("float"); they carry the whole annotation body ("float:64,m/s").
    True only for a SYNTHESISED annotation, which is what the other examples use.
  * TYPE_PARAM_BASE was shown for <float:64,m/s>, which names no base and emits
    no such line.
  * the array example repeated the whole annotation block for every element; it
    is emitted once per row.
  * the datetime example (added with this checker) needs the spec-1.1 directive
    to parse at all.

Every "**Input:** `<source>`" followed by a fenced block is replayed through the
adapter and compared line by line. A block containing an ERROR line is checked
the same way, so the error examples are covered too.

Usage:
    python3 check_conformance_doc.py <path-to-bvnr_conformance_iut>
