check_install_headers.py — every header a consumer can reach is installed.

The public headers include each other, and three of them are GENERATED
(bovnar_units.gen.h, bovnar_profiles.gen.h, bovnar_currency.gen.h). The install
list in CMakeLists.txt names each header explicitly, which is the right thing —
a glob would ship whatever happened to be in include/ — but it is also a second
list, maintained by hand, of something the source already states.

It went wrong exactly the way a second list does: bovnar_profiles.gen.h was
added to bovnar.h and not to the install list, so `make install` produced an
include directory whose bovnar.h could not even preprocess. Nothing caught it.
The library built from the source tree, every test ran against the source tree,
and the only way to see the break was to compile something against an install.

So: start at the headers the install list ships, follow every #include "..."
transitively, and require the closure to be a subset of what is installed.

Usage:  python3 check_install_headers.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when the list is complete, 1 (with the missing names) when it is not.
