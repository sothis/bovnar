"""Render the Bovnar documentation as standalone, SEO-optimized HTML pages.

The canonical docs are Markdown (doc/*.md). They are already published as raw
Markdown (/doc/*.md, great for LLMs) and as PDFs (/doc/pdf/*.pdf), but neither
gives a search engine an indexable HTML page with its own <title>, meta
description, canonical URL, and heading structure. This generator produces one
crawlable page per doc under web/docs/<slug>/index.html, plus a /docs/ index.

Design notes:
  * Inter-doc links (e.g. "02_bovnar_faq.md#foo") are rewritten to the HTML URL
    "/docs/faq/#foo".
  * Heading ids use a GitHub-style slugify so the docs' existing intra-page
    "#anchor" links resolve (the same slugs the raw Markdown assumes).
  * The FAQ page carries FAQPage structured data built from its Q&A headings.
  * Pages are self-contained (inline CSS, no executable inline scripts) with a
    locked-down CSP, so they need no gen_csp restamping.

publish_web.sh runs this before staging. Run by hand: python3 gen_html_docs.py
