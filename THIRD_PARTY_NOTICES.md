# Third-party notices

This file has two parts. **Part 1** covers the six external unit vocabularies
whose identifiers are compiled into the library itself. **Part 2** covers the
third-party components of the website and the build — webfonts, JavaScript
libraries, imagery, and the toolchain whose output is committed.

The MIT grant in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) clause 1 covers **this project's own
contribution**: the native unit registry, the `.bovnar` translation targets, the
refusal rationales, the generators, and every line of C, Python and CMake around
them. It does not, and cannot, grant rights in third-party material. See
`LICENSE` clause 4 for the vocabularies and clause 5 for everything else.

# Part 1 — Unit vocabularies

The unit-profile tables in `src/gendata/` — and the C tables generated from them
into the library, the amalgamation, the WebAssembly build and the Python wheel —
carry identifier strings from **six external vocabularies**. This part records,
for each, what was taken, which published version the table is verified against,
under which licence, and what remains open.

## What is taken, and what is not

**Taken:** identifier strings — a UCUM atom code, a QUDT or OM local name, a
UN/ECE common code, a UDUNITS spelling, a CF standard name. Alongside them, two
kinds of short upstream-derived text, both stated here rather than glossed over:

* **The conventional NAME of a unit**, where a row would otherwise be
  unreadable. A three-letter Rec 20 code is unintelligible without one, so most
  rows of `unece.bvnr` carry a trailing comment such as `# statute mile` or
  `# barrel, US petroleum`; the refusal strings in `ucum.bvnr` do the same, and a
  few of those match UCUM's own `<name>` field word for word (`%[slope]` is
  "percent of slope" in both). These are short factual designations of physical
  units, not the expressive content of any publication, and no mapping table can
  be written or reviewed without them.
* **CF's `canonical_units` field**, which `cf.bvnr` carries in a trailing comment
  on every row and translates into that row's target. §17.2 of
  `doc/11_bovnar_unit_profiles.md` is built on it: it is *what* a `cf:` name
  translates to, so it cannot be paraphrased away.

**Not taken:** no upstream definition, description, annotation, property,
`printSymbol` or explanatory prose. Where a `.bvnr` row carries reasoning — why a
code is refused, why a target is the one it is — that reasoning was written here.
No upstream conversion factor is copied either: every target resolves through
Bovnar's own registry, which `check_profile_factors.py` then compares against the
publisher's value rather than importing it.

**Not redistributed:** no upstream artefact ships with this project, and none is
tracked by git. The publishers' machine-readable definitions are fetched by
`check_profile_factors.py --fetch` into `build/vocab/`, which is git-ignored,
used to verify the tables against their sources, and never packaged. A release
tarball, a wheel, a `.wasm` and the amalgamation contain none of them.

**Adapted, in every case.** No table here reproduces a vocabulary. Each one
extracts that vocabulary's identifiers, maps them onto Bovnar's own unit
registry, and omits every code whose value this project cannot state exactly —
`doc/11_bovnar_unit_profiles.md` §6.4 and §18 record which, and why. Where the
licence below requires a modification notice, this paragraph is it.

**On "verified against".** Each entry below names the published version the table
is currently proved against by `check_profile_factors.py`, and the date that
version was retrieved into the verification cache. It is a statement about what
the rows demonstrably agree with today — which is the checkable claim, and the
one that matters for attribution.

**Status: permission has not yet been obtained, and this is the one entry here
that needs it.** The UCUM licence is revocable, and its §3(a) conditions the
grant on not creating derivative works of the Work and not adding to, deleting
from or modifying its content. `ucum.bvnr` extracts a subset of the atom table
and maps it onto a different unit model, which is a derivative work on the
licence's own definition (§1.3), whatever its purpose. §2 permits developing
"Software Applications that will communicate with and interoperate with the
Work", which is exactly what the `ucum:` namespace is for — but that grant reads
to a program that consumes UCUM, not obviously to a re-encoded table shipped
alongside one.

Two things are true and worth stating plainly, because §3(a) also bars using the
Work to develop or promulgate a different standard for identifying units of
measure, or to dilute UCUM's purpose:

* Bovnar's native unit notation was designed and specified independently of
  UCUM, is not offered as a replacement for it, and is not derived from it. The
  `ucum:` namespace exists so that a producer holding a UCUM code can write it
  down unchanged rather than translating it by hand first.
* A UCUM code is never silently reinterpreted. A code this project cannot carry
  exactly is refused — `error_unit_profile_unsupported` if UCUM defines it and
  Bovnar cannot represent it, `error_unit_illegal` if UCUM does not define it —
  and never approximated onto a nearby unit.

**Open action:** request written permission from Regenstrief Institute to
distribute this derived mapping table. Until that is granted, the `ucum:`
profile can be excluded from any build with `-DBVNR_WITH_UCUM_PROFILE=OFF`
(`doc/11` §9.4), which drops the table from the library entirely.

OM is published by an EEA maker, so the EU sui generis database right
(§§ 87a ff. UrhG) is the relevant right alongside copyright. CC BY 4.0 §2(a)(1)
licenses it expressly, so the extraction is covered.

## UDUNITS-2 — Unidata units library

## CF — Climate and Forecast standard names

| **Source** | <https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/94/src/cf-standard-name-table.xml> |
| **Home** | <https://cfconventions.org/> |
| **Extracted** | standard names, and the `canonical_units` each name states |

> Contains standard names from the CF standard name table, maintained on behalf

> quantity *is* and a unit does not know that.

**Status: no licence is stated by the publisher.** The CF *conventions document*
is dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0
(<https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions>), but the standard name table
is maintained separately, in `cf-convention/vocabularies`, which carries no
`LICENSE` file and no in-band rights statement. Nothing suggests the CF
community intends the table to be restricted — it exists to be embedded in data
files worldwide — but there is no grant to point at.

**Open action:** ask the CF community to declare an explicit licence for the
standard name table, proposing CC0 1.0 to match the conventions document. Until
then this attribution stands in its place, and the `cf:` profile can be excluded
from any build with `-DBVNR_WITH_CF_PROFILE=OFF`.

## UN/ECE — Recommendations 20 and 21

| | |
|---|---|
| **Used in** | `src/gendata/unece.bvnr`, the `unece:` profile |
| **Vocabulary** | Recommendation No. 20, *Codes for Units of Measure Used in International Trade*, and Recommendation No. 21, *Codes for Passengers, Types of Cargo, Packages and Packaging Materials* |
| **Verified against** | QUDT 3.1.0's `qudt:uneceCommonCode` cross-reference — see below |
| **Home** | <https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/cl-recommendations> |
| **Extracted** | UN/ECE common codes, and the conventional name of a unit in a trailing comment on most rows |

> Contains UN/ECE common codes from UN/CEFACT Recommendations 20 and 21,
> published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Neither UNECE
> nor UN/CEFACT endorses this project or its use of the codes.

**Verified at one remove, through QUDT.** Recommendation 20 states its conversion
factors in prose, so there is no machine-readable publication to resolve against.
Every row of `unece.bvnr` is therefore proved against QUDT's published
`uneceCommonCode` cross-reference rather than against a UNECE artefact
(`check_profile_factors.py`, class `Unece`), and that cross-reference — not this
project's reading of a code list — is what decided the table's contents when it
was closed: `git log src/gendata/unece.bvnr` records rows being retargeted, and
others left out, on the strength of QUDT's label for the unit carrying the code.

Nothing in this repository reads or ships a UNECE publication; `check_profile_factors.py`
lists no UNECE source, and no UNECE file is tracked by git. What this project
cannot state is where each code was *first* encountered by its author over the
months the table was written by hand, which is why nothing here claims a UNECE
document was never consulted. What is UNECE's in the result is the codes.

**Status: formally unresolved, practically low risk.** The generic United
Nations website terms permit only personal, non-commercial download, without a
right to redistribute or to create derivative works. Those terms plainly are not
aimed at the code lists: Rec 20 exists to be implemented, and is implemented in
UN/EDIFACT, UBL, Peppol/EN 16931, ISO 20022, OPC UA and QUDT among many others.
The operative instrument is the UN/CEFACT Intellectual Property Rights Policy,
under which UN/CEFACT deliverables are made available for implementation
royalty-free.

**Open action:** obtain written confirmation of the reuse terms from
<cefact@unece.org>, and record it here.

## Other reference data

Two further external sources are used, neither of them a unit vocabulary and
neither raising the questions above:

* **ISO 4217** currency codes, numeric codes and minor-unit digits, in
  `src/gendata/currencies.bvnr`. The three-letter code list is published by the
  ISO 4217 Maintenance Agency (SIX Group) for free use, and codes and numeric
  identifiers are facts rather than expression. Cryptocurrency tickers are not
  ISO 4217 and are conventional.
* **CODATA 2022** for the one measured constant in `src/gendata/units.bvnr` —
  the atomic mass constant behind `Da`/`u`/`amu`. CODATA recommended values are
  published for unrestricted use; the edition is named in that file's header
  because a value without its edition cannot be checked. Every other factor in
  the registry is exact by definition or by convention.

# Part 2 — Website and build components

The vocabularies above are the material this project *reasoned* about. They are
not the only third-party material it ships. The repository also tracks, and
<https://www.bovnar.io> also serves, several components that came from other
people — two webfonts, two JavaScript libraries, two NASA images — and the
committed WebAssembly artifact is the output of a third-party toolchain.

None of these raises a question of the kind Part 1 does: every licence here is a
plain permissive one. Each does carry a notice obligation, and this part is that
notice.

## Webfonts — IBM Plex Sans, JetBrains Mono

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `web/fonts/ibm-plex-sans-*.woff2`, `web/fonts/jetbrains-mono-*.woff2` |
| **Licence** | SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (both) |

> Copyright © 2017 IBM Corp. with Reserved Font Name "Plex" —
> <https://github.com/IBM/plex>
>
> Copyright 2020 The JetBrains Mono Project Authors —
> <https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono>

The OFL requires that **every copy of the Font Software carry the copyright
notice and the licence**, and a browser downloading a `.woff2` from the site is
receiving a copy. That is why [`web/fonts/OFL.txt`](web/fonts/OFL.txt) exists
and is uploaded with the rest of `web/`: a link from a CSS comment would not
have satisfied it.

Both files are **subsets** (latin, greek) of the upstream variable fonts,
generated from the Google Fonts css2 API and rehosted so the site has no
`fonts.googleapis`/`gstatic` dependency. Subsetting makes them Modified Versions
under OFL §2; neither Reserved Font Name is changed, and neither font is sold on
its own.

## highlight.js 11.9.0

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `web/highlight-11.9.0.min.js` |
| **Licence** | BSD 3-Clause — <https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/LICENSE> |

> Copyright (c) 2006, Ivan Sagalaev. Highlight.js v11.9.0 (git: f47103d4f1),
> licensed under BSD-3-Clause.

The minified file retains its own `/*! … */` banner, which is what carries the
notice to anyone who fetches it — but that banner reads "(c) 2006-2023 undefined
and other contributors", an upstream build slip that names no copyright holder
at all. The line quoted above is the one from the project's own `LICENSE`, which
is why this entry states it rather than repeating the banner. Neither the
copyright holder's nor the contributors' names are used to endorse this project.

## marked 9.1.6

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `web/marked-9.1.6.min.js` |
| **Licence** | MIT — <https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/LICENSE> |

> marked v9.1.6 — a markdown parser. Copyright (c) 2011-2023, Christopher
> Jeffrey. (MIT Licensed) — <https://github.com/markedjs/marked>

The minified file retains the copyright line but not the full MIT permission
text, which the licence asks to accompany substantial portions. The upstream
`LICENSE` linked above is that text, and this entry is the pointer to it.

## Earth imagery — NASA

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `web/earth.jpg` (Blue Marble, cloud-free, equirectangular), `web/earth_night.jpg` (Black Marble night lights) |
| **Status** | Not subject to copyright in the United States |

> Images courtesy of NASA. NASA does not endorse this project.

NASA media are generally not copyrighted and may be reused, including
commercially, with NASA credited as the source. Credit is the whole of the
obligation, and it is given here and — because a comment in a source file is not
a credit anyone reading the site can see — publicly, in the *Bildnachweis*
section of <https://www.bovnar.io/impressum.html>.

## Emscripten

| | |
|---|---|
| **Affects** | `web/bovnar_wasm_core.js`, `dist/wasm/bovnar*.mjs` and the committed `.wasm` — all `emcc` output (`wasm/build_wasm.sh`) |
| **Licence** | dual MIT / University of Illinois NCSA — <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/LICENSE> |

> Portions of the generated JavaScript glue are Emscripten runtime code,
> copyright the Emscripten authors. Emscripten is dual-licensed under the MIT
> licence and the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License; it is used
> here under the MIT option.

The C that Emscripten compiles is this project's own; what is Emscripten's is
the loader and runtime shims it emits around it. Its licence expressly permits
distributing that output, and asks for the notice this entry gives.

## Date algorithms — Howard Hinnant

| | |
|---|---|
| **Affects** | `include/bvn_gregorian_date.h`, `src/utils/bvn_gregorian_date.c` |
| **Status** | Donated to the public domain by the author |

> The civil-date ↔ day-number conversions are derived from Howard Hinnant's
> *chrono-Compatible Low-Level Date Algorithms*,
> <https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html>, of which the author
> writes: "Consider these donated to the public domain."

This is the only algorithm in the C sources derived from a published
implementation rather than from a specification or from first principles, and
`bvn_gregorian_date.h` has credited it in its header since it was written.
There is no obligation attached; it is recorded here because a notices file that
lists a webfont and omits an algorithm is not telling the whole story.

The claim that it is the *only* one is bounded, not absolute: it rests on a
sweep of every source comment in `src/`, `include/` and `python/bovnar/` for
external URLs and for the phrases a derivation is normally marked with, which
found this and nothing else.

## Not third-party, despite appearances

* `web/bovnar_highlight.js`, `web/bovnar_wasm.js`, `web/bovnar_parser_wasm.js`
  and the editor definitions under `highlighter/` — the Sublime syntax and
  colour scheme, the VS Code grammar and theme, the Vim, Geany and CLion
  definitions — are **clean-room original work**, written for this project
  against the Bovnar grammar rather than adapted from any existing syntax
  definition, theme or template.
* `dist/linguist/languages.yml.fragment` and `dist/mime/*` are likewise original
  and written *for* those projects rather than extracted from them: a fragment
  to be contributed upstream, not a copy of anything upstream holds.
* Development-time dependencies that are never redistributed — `pint`, `numpy`,
  `markdown`, `emsdk`, CMake, the compilers — are outside the scope of this
  file, which covers only what this project actually ships.

---

## Keeping this file true

* Each `src/gendata/*.bvnr` profile file repeats its own provenance block in its
  header, so the version and licence travel with the data rather than only with
  this file.
* `check_profile_factors.py` pins the exact upstream URI it verifies against,
  including the CF table version — never a `current/` alias, which would make
  the provenance recorded here unreproducible.
* Bumping a vocabulary to a new upstream version means updating the version and
  retrieval date here and in the `.bvnr` header in the same commit.
* Adding a third-party file to `web/` — a font, a library, an image — means an
  entry in Part 2 in the same commit, and, where the licence requires the text
  itself to travel with the file, a licence file served beside it.
* Every claim in this file is meant to be checkable from the repository. Where
  something is not — where it would depend on how the author worked rather than
  on what the tree contains — this file says so instead of asserting it. The
  UN/ECE entry is the worked example.
* **The links in this file are not gated.** `check_web_links.py` resolves
  internal links only, by design: no test here may need the network. So an
  upstream project that renames its licence file leaves a dead link in a notices
  document, which is the one kind of rot this file cannot detect about itself —
  two of them were already introduced and caught by hand. Spot-check the URLs
  when touching an entry.
* Where the notices must reach a consumer who never sees this repository, that
  path is verified rather than assumed: the Python wheel carries `LICENSE` and
  this file under `dist-info/licenses/` with both declared as `License-File` in
  its metadata, `pack_artifacts.cmake` copies it into every binary archive and
  the amalgamation drop, and `dist/wasm/README.md` — the README npm publishes —
  points at it.
