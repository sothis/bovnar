check_doc_python_examples.py — doc/09's `# →` expectations, actually evaluated.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. doc/09 is the Python reference and it states its results the
way a reader reads them:

    bovnar.unit_to_profile("unece", kg)   # → "KGM"
    f = bovnar.unit_factor("M~Hz")        # → 1_000_000.0

Nothing ran any of it. check_doc_examples.py parses the embedded *bovnar*
documents, check_doc_unit_tables.py checks doc/09's BaseUnit range table, and the
76 KB of Python either side of those was the copy nobody executed. Three claims
in it were wrong at once, all in the section describing `UnitFlags.REDUCE`: that
`unit_reduce` yields "the canonical named SI unit" (it yields `m·g/s²` where the
formatter yields `N`), that a caller should apply `unit_reduce(vu).scale` to a
value it is also going to serialise (that double-applies wherever the formatter
re-attaches a prefix — `k~N` is out by 1000), and that a reduction overflows the
"±9 exponent range" (it is ±100, and has been since the exponent range grew).

WHAT IS CHECKED. Every ```python block is executed in order, in one namespace, so
a block may build on the one before it exactly as a reader would. On each line
carrying a `# →` comment, the expression to its left is evaluated a second time
and its result compared with what the comment claims.

WHAT IS SKIPPED, AND LOUDLY. A block that needs something this gate cannot supply
— a file on disk, a handler defined elsewhere, an optional third-party import —
raises, and the whole block is skipped from that point. The count of skipped
blocks is printed on every run, so "nothing is checked any more" cannot look like
success. A block may also opt out with a `# check-doc-python: skip` line, which
is the honest way to exclude a snippet that is deliberately illustrative.

Comparison is deliberately loose about FORM and strict about VALUE: the comment
is prose written for a reader, so `"KGM"`, `'KGM'` and `KGM` all match the string
KGM, `1_000_000.0` matches the float, and any trailing commentary after two
spaces or an em-dash is ignored. A comment that is not parseable as a value at
all (`# → a Quantity`) is not a claim and is skipped.

Usage:  python3 check_doc_python_examples.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when every stated result matches, 1 with a list when not.
