"""Where the documentation gates find the build they are checking.

The check_doc_*.py gates put claims in the documents to the reference
implementation: they load libbvnr through the Python package, run the CLI, run
the per-profile test binaries. Each used to look for those under <repo>/build
and, finding nothing, print "no built library; skipped" and exit 0 -- which is
right for somebody running a script by hand in a fresh clone, and wrong under
CTest, where a build directory by any other name (build-asan, out/, a packager's
obj-x86_64) made six registered tests pass without having checked anything, or
check the binaries of a different build.

CTest now says where the build is (LIBBOVNAR_PATH, which the Python package
reads by itself; BOVNAR_CLI; BVNR_TESTS_DIR) and sets BVNR_REQUIRE_BUILD, under
which a missing piece is a failure instead of a skip.
