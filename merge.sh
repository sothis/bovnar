#   bvnr_src-nocomments.txt …   the same five dumps, comment-free
#
# Everything is written on every run: two zips and both dump sets, side by side.
# There is no option to pick one. A dump is a few megabytes next to a build tree
# that is hundreds, the comment-free set costs one extra pass over a staging copy
# that has to be made for the zip anyway, and a flag that changes which files
# appear under fixed names is a trap -- bvnr_src.txt would mean one thing on
# Tuesday and another on Wednesday. The -nocomments suffix says which is which.

#
# Comment stripping
# -----------------
# One tool, strip_lang_comments.py, with a scanner per language. That is not
# pedantry: every one of these formats can write its comment marker without
# starting a comment, and this tree does. `#` appears inside CMake quoted
# arguments in its own CTest registry, `<!--` inside a <script> on the landing
# page, `//` inside strings and regexes in the vendored highlighter, `/*` inside
# a C string literal, and a Bovnar octet stream carries arbitrary bytes -- `#`,
# LF, NUL -- in length-prefixed chunks.
#
# It replaces strip_comments.sh (C only, no verification, and it deleted the
# licence header) and strip.sh (which rewrote the working tree in place, needed a
# clean-tree guard for it, and had no caller). Its C path is byte-for-byte
# compatible with strip_comments.sh, checked against it over all 82 files before
# that script was removed.
#
# Everything happens in a throwaway staging copy, so the tree is never modified.
#
# The leading SPDX/copyright block of every file survives: it IS a comment, so a
# stripper removes it, and the MIT licence requires the notice to be retained.
# The tool now applies that rule itself, in all nine languages -- along with a
# vendored /*! @license */ banner, a `#!` shebang, a PEP 263 coding cookie, IE
# conditional comments, the `<!-- bovnar:retired-path -->` markers three doc
# checkers read, and the first comment of a Bovnar document, which is the only
# place `#!bovnar 1.1` can be.
#
# Nothing here is taken on trust. strip_lang_comments.py refuses to write a file
# whose syntax tree, token stream, canonical XML or parse events changed, and a
# build of the stripped tree is what proves the C strip -- see the "Verifying"
# section at the bottom of this file.
#
# NOT stripped: plain text, *.min.js (no comments beyond the licence banner, and
# minified regex-versus-division is a real risk for no gain), and JavaScript or
# CSS comments that sit inside an HTML <script>/<style> element rather than in a
# .js/.css file. Strict JSON cannot carry a comment, so the .json files come
# through unchanged and the tool proves it -- except the two JSONC ones, a VS
# Code settings file and a colour theme, where `//` really is a comment.
#
# Hardening:
#   set -e          abort on the first failing command (e.g. an unreadable file)
#   set -u          treat an unset variable as an error
#   set -o pipefail a failure anywhere in a pipeline fails the whole pipeline
#   failglob        a glob that matches nothing is a hard error rather than being
#                   passed through literally — so a moved/renamed source set
#                   stops the build loudly instead of silently dropping a section.
#
# The dumps used to be built with `tail -n +1 <glob>`, which had four problems:
#
#   * A directory in a glob is fatal. Adding doc/wiki/ broke the script outright
#     — `tail: error reading 'doc/wiki': Is a directory`, exit 1, and the final
#     bvnr_py_src_exmpl_doc_web.txt was never produced at all. clean.sh ends by
#     calling this script, so a clean run ended in failure too.
#   * Binary content landed in files advertised as text: examples/octet_streams
#     .bvnr embeds an octet stream, which put 932 NUL bytes into the dumps.
#   * `tail -n +1` prints the "==> name <==" header only when given MORE THAN ONE
#     file, so a source set that happened to match exactly one file lost its
#     filename marker.
#   * A set that failed left yesterday's output file in place, so a partial
#     bundle looked complete.
#
# Files are therefore expanded to regular files explicitly, binary ones are
# recorded by name and size instead of being inlined, every file gets a header,
# and the outputs are removed up front.
#
# What goes into the zips
# -----------------------
# The prune list used to name `build` exactly, so a second build tree -- the
# build-asan/, build-ubsan/, cmake-build-release/ directories a sanitizer or
# IDE run leaves behind -- was packed into the archive: megabytes of object
# files and CMake caches shipped as "source". The prune list now covers those
# by pattern, and on top of that every path git ignores is dropped, which is
# the same rule .gitignore already states (`build*/*`) and needs no upkeep the
# next time a build directory gets a new name. The count of paths the git
# filter removed is printed, so that pass is never silent.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- verifying --
# strip_lang_comments.py checks each file against its own language before writing
# it -- a syntax tree, token stream, canonical XML or parse-event set that moved
# means the file is refused, not shipped. For C that check shares its scanner
# with the strip, so it is the weakest of the nine, and nothing above proves the
# result still builds either way. The check for both is to build the two zips and
# compare, and it is worth redoing after any change to the stripping step:
#
#   out=$PWD/build/merged
#   for z in bovnar bovnar-nocomments; do

#
# Both trees must register the same number of tests (159 + 15 example documents
# at the time of writing) and build clean, and every test must reach the same
# verdict in both -- except for the five below, which are the complete expected
# difference. Each one asserts something ABOUT comments or about a hash of a file
# whose comments were removed; none of them means the code stopped working, and
# the whole point of running both trees is that a SIXTH difference would.
#
#   bvnr_py_all, bvnr_py_pure_all  fail on one case of 2533:
#       test_units_example_derived_count_matches_its_own_header reads the comment
#       "(N named SI-derived units)" out of examples/units.bvnr and counts the
#       keys beneath it. Its subject is a comment, so a comment-free tree cannot
#       satisfy it by construction.
#   bvnr_wasm_freshness  hashes the library sources and compares against the
#       stamp wasm/build_wasm.sh recorded, so a tree whose sources differ by as
#       little as a comment is correctly reported as not the one the committed
#       module was built from. Rewriting the stamp to match would be a lie about
#       provenance; this zip is a copy to read, not one to ship a playground from.
#   bvnr_cache_stamps, bvnr_font_stamps  the ?v= cache-busting stamps in
#       web/index.html ARE content hashes of the .js and .css they label, so
#       stripping those files necessarily moves them. The page still loads -- a
#       stamp is a cache-busting hint, not a load requirement -- and re-deriving
#       the stamps here would mean reimplementing three generators
#       (build_wasm.sh, gen_font_stamps.py, gen_html_docs.py) inside a bundling
#       script. If a green run matters more than comment-free web assets, drop
#       -iname '*.js'/'*.mjs'/'*.css' from the staging find above.
#   bvnr_html_docs  fails in BOTH trees for a reason unrelated to stripping:
#       gen_html_docs.py stamps each page with its git commit date and falls back
#       to file mtimes when there is no history (see shallow_clone() there), and
#       an unzipped tree has no .git. It passes in the repository itself. In the
#       stripped tree it also lists web/docs/index.html, which carries the
#       ?v= stamp of docs.css -- the same cause as bvnr_cache_stamps.
#
# Two checks worth running when the Bovnar or Markdown scanners change, because
# no ctest gate covers exactly what they do:
#
#   * every .bvnr file through the CLI, before and after. Copy the two files to
#     paths of EQUAL length first: `bovnar events` derives its column width from
#     the path, so a longer name alone changes where the output wraps.
#         for c in events validate pretty-print "pretty-print --canonical"; do
#             build/bovnar $c a.bvnr; build/bovnar $c b.bvnr; done
#     All 32 documents in the tree, the 226 KB octet-stream example included,
#     produce byte-identical output for all four.
#   * `python3 gen_html_docs.py` in both trees, then diff web/docs/ with the
#     dates and ?v= stamps normalised. All 14 pages must come out identical,
#     which is what proves the Markdown strip changed nothing the generator sees.
