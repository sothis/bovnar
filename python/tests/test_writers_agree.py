"""
The C writer and the Python writer must agree about every unit-carrying shape.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `dumps()` emitted a string's unit as an annotation
parameter -- `<utf8:m> "x"` -- which this library's own reader refuses, so
`loads(typed=True)` -> `dumps` -> `loads` failed on a document it had just read.
The C writer emitted `<utf8> "x" m;` and round-tripped throughout. Two writers,
one shape, and only one of them could read its own output back.

Nothing compared them. The Python suite round-trips through `dumps`, the C suite
round-trips through the C writer, and each was self-consistent. What was missing
is the cross-check: hand the same document to both and require the two outputs
to re-read to the same thing.

Skips, rather than passes, when the CLI is not built -- the point is the
comparison, and a green tick without it would say the opposite of the truth.
