"""
Generate a single-file amalgamation of the Bovnar library into build/amalgamate/:

    build/amalgamate/bovnar.h  -- the complete public API (all include/*.h)
    build/amalgamate/bovnar.c  -- the complete implementation (all src/**/*.{c,h}
                                  except the CLI src/bovnar.c), #include "bovnar.h"

A consumer then needs only those two files:

    cc -c bovnar.c -o bovnar.o          # build the library object
    #include "bovnar.h"                  # use the API

Project `#include "..."` directives are resolved and each project header is
inlined exactly once; system `#include <...>` directives are hoisted and
deduplicated. The build under build/ remains the authoritative one; this is a
convenience distribution form. Run tests/amalgam_smoke.c (CTest target
`bvnr_amalgam`) to verify the generated files compile and work.
