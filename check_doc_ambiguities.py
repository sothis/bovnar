check_doc_ambiguities.py — every claim doc/07 makes, put to the reference parser.

doc/07 is the document a reader consults when a token could mean two things, and
its header promises exactly this:

    Every row here was checked against the reference parser; where a token is
    refused, it really is `error_unit_illegal`.

That was true when each table was written and nothing re-asked it, which is the
one property a table of REFUSALS cannot keep on its own: a refusal rots the
moment the catalogue grows. Adding a unit spelled `usb`, or an alias that made
`kWh` resolve, would leave §4 and §13 asserting an error the library no longer
raises — and in the direction no test notices, because nothing fails when a
document merely lies about a capability.

WHAT IS CHECKED, section by section. Each is the table's own content, not a
restatement of it:

  §2  a bare unit outranks a prefixed reading — the Token parses, and the
      "Write that as" spelling parses to a DIFFERENT unit (which is the whole
      claim: the two readings exist and are not the same one).
  §3  two prefixed readings compete — the same shape.
  §4  refused outright — the Token is `error_unit_illegal`, and every
      replacement offered beside it parses.
  §5  prefix symbol vs base unit symbol — the row's own claim, in two halves:
      the bare symbol parses as a unit, and `<symbol>~s` parses as a DIFFERENT
      unit, which is what "before another unit they are always the prefix"
      means. Everything the example cell offers in backticks must parse, and a
      compact/separated pair in it must agree; that last part is best-effort,
      since the cell is prose and may pair its spellings however it reads best.
  §9  same dimension, different quantity — the accept-list rows are mutually
      convertible and carry the dimension stated beside them; the refuse-list
      rows really are refused; and the five worked conversions return what the
      table says. The "families, in full" sentence is checked for CLOSURE too,
      since a new native unit of one of those dimensions joins the family
      whether or not anybody updates the sentence.
  §13 looks like a unit, is not one — every "Written" token is refused and every
      "Write instead" spelling parses; and the two tokens listed as accepted but
      surprising really are accepted.

Needs the built library, because the question is what the reader does; it skips
rather than fails when there is none, the same rule check_profile_factors.py
follows.

Usage:  python3 check_doc_ambiguities.py [repo-root]
Exit 0 when doc/07 and the library agree, 1 with a list when they do not.
